# Demo

![](docs/demo.gif)

It uses the excellent [tview](https://github.com/rivo/tview) library for the UI.

# Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/paololazzari/play
$ cd play
$ go build -o /usr/local/bin/
```

# Usage

```bash
./play <program>
```

N.B. The program must be installed on your machine.

The input is evaluated immediately as you type without any validation.
If you want to use `play` in read-only mode, thus avoding any file changes (such as those that would result if, for instance, `sed -i` was used), then you can use a docker container:

```bash
$ docker run -e "TERM=xterm-256color" --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/play:ro plazzari/play:latest <program>
```

The `TERM` environment variable is needed to get color themes working properly.

To exit the application, use `Ctrl+C`.

To exit the application printing the input expression to stdout, use `Ctrl+S`.
